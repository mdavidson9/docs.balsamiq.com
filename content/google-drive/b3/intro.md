## Overview

Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive provides the same functionality as [other Balsamiq Mockups products](https://balsamiq.com/products/compare/). The difference is that **the files are stored and managed by Google Drive**. If you use other Google Drive apps (Google Docs, for example), the file management features should be very familiar to you.

You can easily [share your mockups](../drive-files/#sharing-via-google-drive) using the built-in features of Google Drive, [even if other people don't have the Balsamiq app installed](https://support.balsamiq.com/plugins/sharingwithgoogledrive/). If they do have the app, [you can edit your mockups at the same time](../collaborating/).

## Creating a New Project

There are two ways to create a new Balsamiq Mockups project in Google Drive.

1.  You can click **"New > Balsamiq Mockups Project"** from the Google Drive file list as shown above.
2.  If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also launch Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type "chrome://apps/"). Click the big Balsamiq Mockups icon and it will open the editor directly.

![Chrome Apps](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/chromeapps.png)

​Either method will launch the Balsamiq Mockups editor to allow you to create your mockups (or [import existing ones](#importing-from-other-versions-of-balsamiq-mockups)). This will also create a new Balsamiq Mockups file (.bmpr file extension) in your Google Drive. If you launched Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps page your files will be saved in your Drive's home folder. Otherwise they will be saved in the folder you had selected when you created the new Mockups project.

## Using the Balsamiq Mockups Editor

The Balsamiq Mockups editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the [application overview](../overview/) to learn more about using the editor.

## Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups

If you have a project created in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (with a .bmpr extension) you can just upload it to Google Drive and edit it directly.

If you want to open a project containing .bmml files (Balsamiq Mockups version 2) see the documentation on [importing mockups from a previous version](../importing/).

## Returning to Google Drive (Closing the Editor)

When you are done editing your mockups you can exit the editor by selecting "Quit" in the Project menu. This will also create a new [version](../drive-files/#managing-versions) of the file in case you want to revert to it later.
