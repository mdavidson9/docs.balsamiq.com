Balsamiq Cloud is all about collaboration and we offer many ways for you to get feedback on your designs. This document outlines a few different ways so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.

For sharing with colleagues: just have your [site owner](../people/#site-owners) invite them as [staff members](../people/#staff-members). Once they’re set up as staff members on your Balsamiq Cloud site, you can quickly [invite them](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project) to projects.

## Make Them a Project Member

Adding someone as a project member gives them the ability to view a project and comment there, but also edit the wireframes if you give them the permission to do so.

To add someone as a project member, just [invite them](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project) and select the desired permission.

## Allow Public Reviews

An easy way to share one project is to **Allow Public Reviews** from its sharing settings.

Clicking this checkbox will allow anyone to [review and comment](#review-and-comment) on the project, including anonymous users that you have shared the project link with.

## Review and Comment

The "Review and Comment" mode is a great option for anyone who does not need to edit the wireframes. Some users will only have access to this mode (see [managing user permissions](../people/#managing-user-permissions-on-projects)) but editors can switch to this mode from the top-right option in the [toolbar](../cloud/overview/#the-toolbar).

Notice how the border color around the profile picture translates the [access level](../people/#user-permissions-at-a-glance).

The comments panel allows you to collaborate on your designs by sharing feedback asynchronously or, if you prefer, making notes for yourself as you work. A new comment will generate a notification in the toolbar.

### Callouts

You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies.

### Link to an Alternate Version

You can also add a link to an alternate version.

### Comment Actions

Once a comment is added, each reviewer can reply to it and like it. You can also edit and delete your own comments.

## Full Screen Presentation Mode

Balsamiq Cloud includes a full screen presentation mode for presenting your wireframes to stakeholders or usability testing.

To enter Full Screen Presentation mode, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of Mockups, or select "Full Screen Presentation" from the View menu, or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-topbar.png)

Balsamiq Mockups will expand to take up your whole screen, with your mockup centered on it.

The far left icon toggles the top bar on and off. You can turn it off to remove everything but the mockup (even the icon will disappear until the cursor is placed over it), this is useful for usability testing when you want a more realistic experience.

### Navigating between Mockups

You can navigate between mockups using the icons in the upper left. They behave like the navigation icons in the editor [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar). The up and down arrows navigate between your mockups in order, while the icon activated below allows you to jump directly to a specific mockup.   

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-navigation.png)

If you have created mockup [alternates](../alternates), a menu will appear when you mouse over the mockup, allowing you to select and display the alternates. If you are viewing an alternate, its name will appear in parentheses next to the offical mockup name.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-alternates.png)

If you have created [links](../linking/) between your mockups, the links will be clickable in full screen presentation mode.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/bighand.png)

### Settings

By default you will also see a big **blue arrow** pointer in place of the regular mouse cursor. This is useful for presenting your mockups. The pointer will point towards the center of the screen in order to always stay out of the way of your mockup as much as possible.

You can turn off the big blue arrow in the full screen settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right to open the settings panel.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-settings.png)

The settings panel also has an option to turn on and off **link hints**. When link hints are on areas that contain [links](../linking/) will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.

The **Markup** setting is for showing and hiding [markup](../markup/) elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the "Markup" tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.

The last setting is to set the view to **zoom** out to fit the largest mockup. All other mockups will be zoomed relative to the largest mockup.

There are keyboard shortcuts for each setting, shown next to the setting name in the panel. No modifier key is required in full screen mode (e.g., just L for link hints, not CTRL/CMD+L)

The info icon next to the settings icon will open a panel to view and edit notes for the selected mockup, just like in normal edit mode.

To exit Full Screen Presentation mode, hit the ESC key or click the icon in the upper right corner.

### Adjusting Your Project's Centering

Full Screen Presentation Mode centers your entire project based on the mockup that is the tallest, and the mockup that is the widest. While this normally results in a presentation that is centered (and whose focus doesn't jump around), if you have a mockup that is a great deal larger than your other mockups, it may result in your project being off center, or pushed to the top of the screen.

In the [Settings](../fullscreen#settings) panel, you will find a link called **Project Centering Rules**.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-centering_rules_link.png)

Clicking that link will open a window that gives you an overview of the size of all the mockups in your project. It will show you the longest and widest mockups in project, and the effective size they are making your project as a whole. The longest mockup will have its width in red, while the tallest mockup will have it's height in blue. This should give you a hint as to what mockup is causing your project to center incorrectly.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-centering_rules_default.png)

Clicking the checkbox next to the trouble mockup (or mockups) will take them out of the centering calculation (and will recalculate the new longest/widest mockups, adjusting the overall project size).

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/fullscreen-centering_rules_changed.png)

This should solve any centering issues you have!

## Share an Interactive PDF Document

PDFs generated in Balsamiq Cloud are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect [any links](../linking) you have added to the project as well. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don't need to make changes.

The PDF will be created in high resolution and with selectable text (good for the reviewers to copy/paste from). More details about exporting to PDF can be found [here](../exporting/#exporting-to-pdf).

---

## Share PNG Images

You can export all of your wireframes to static PNG images, and send those to your clients. More info about that feature [here](../exporting/#exporting-to-an-image).
