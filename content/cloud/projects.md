In each of your sites, you will find a collection of projects that you and your team are working on.

From this page you can create and upload as many projects as your [subscription](Need link) allows. If you have existing Balsamiq (.bmpr) files you can just **drag them on to this screen to upload** them.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you were invited to join a site, it is likely that there will be projects available to you already. {{% /alert %}}

When you click on the "Create Project" button, you will immediately be taken to the Balsamiq Wireframes editor, and get started wireframing quickly. When you are done (or want to take a break) your work will be waiting for you on your projects home page.

To edit a project, just click on it to load the [Balsamiq Wireframes editor](../overview/).

## Cloning, Downloading, and Deleting Projects

From your projects homepage, you can Clone, Download, or Delete projects. You'll find the options for this on the bottom right corner of the project's card.

Downloading and deleting can also be done with multiple projects at once. Clicking on the check box in the bottom left corner will select a project, and you can do this with as many projects as you want. When projects have been "checked", a set of options will appear in the upper right corner of the screen. They will allow you to download or delete the selected projects.
