After successfully logging into Balsamiq Cloud, you will be greeted by your Sites Homepage. From this page you can access any of your existing sites, or create a new one. To access an existing site, simply click on it, and you will be brought to that site's [project page](../projects/).

## Creating a New Site

To create a new Balsamiq Cloud Site, click the plus button in the upper left corner of your Sites Homepage. A screen will pop up asking you to name the site, and remind you of our [subscription tiers](need a link).

Give your site a name and click the **Create Site & Start Free Trial** to create it.

## Managing Your Site Settings

Once in your site, you can access the site settings by clicking the **Settings** link at the top of the page. From this page you can change/add [Site Owners](../people/#site-owners) or delete the site completely.

### Changing and Adding Site Owners

In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two [Site Owners](../people/#site-owners) per site. By default, the site's creator will be Site Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another [Staff Member](../people/#staff-members) from the dropdown.

You can specify a second Site Owner via the second dropdown. A second Site Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!

### Deleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Site

Deleting a site can only be done by the [Site Owner](../people/#site-owners). To do this, type the name of the site and click the **Delete Site** button. If you have an active subscription for the site, deleting the site will cancel it.

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Deleting a site cannot be undone. All of your project data will be deleted immediately, with no way to recover it. {{% /alert %}}

## Managing Users

Clicking the **People** link at the top of the page will show a list of all the users of the site and the projects they belong to. Click on the number of projects they belong to to see a list.

Add users by entering one or more email addresses in the box at the bottom of the page.

### Making Someone a Staff Member

Checking the "Staff" checkbox will make someone a Staff Member, allowing them to create and own projects. See [People and Permissions](../people/#staff-members) to learn more about their privileges.

### Deleting Users

To remove a person from the site, click the **X** to the far right of their name. They will no longer be able to access any projects, except those that allow [public (anonymous) reviews](../people/#allow-public-reviews).
