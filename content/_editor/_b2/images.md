To use images in Mockups, **add an Image control from the UI Library** and place it on the canvas. The Image drop-down in the Property Inspector will allow you to select images that have already been used in your mockup or images that have been imported to your [Project Assets](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/117761#projectassets) or [Account Assets](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/200694#settingup) folder.

The Project Assets panel shows all images in your assets folder. If you have Site/Account assets, a tab will appear for them. If you use web images or images using relative paths that are not project assets, those will show in the Other Assets tab. On the desktop, you'll also see a handy link to open the Account Assets folder when you click on the Account Assets tab.

Click the plus icon in the upper right corner of the drop-down to choose a new image, or just double-click on the Image UI control to quickly bring up the image browser dialog. You can choose images from your hard drive or networked drive, or from the Web or Flickr. Mockups supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats.

If you are working on a saved file, you can also just drag an image from your computer to the Mockups canvas.

To rotate an image after it's been imported, click the rotate icon next to the Image drop-down in the Property Inspector. To convert an image to a black and white line drawing version, click the "Sketch It" checkbox in the image import dialog or the Property Inspector.

To revert an image to the default placeholder image, click the icon in the upper left corner of the image drop-down (the square with an 'x' inside it).

The video below gives a good introduction to the Image Import feature and what you can do with it.

<div style="min-height: 385px"><object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kniGOJXtKJ4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kniGOJXtKJ4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></object></div>

Aside from the Image control, you can also embed images in the Cover Flow component.

## Cropping Images

You can also crop (mask) images to only show a selected portion of them.

The video below illustrates how to use this powerful feature:

<div style="min-height: 480px"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GOnCNNHhfGc" width="640"></iframe></div>

_Note: see [this article](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1430586) for a demonstration of this process in a newer version of Mockups._

## Copying Images to Assets

When you add images to Mockups, what we suggest is that you also add them to "project assets" so they will stay organized with the project and may be re-used in other mockups.

Here's how:

*   If your Mockup isn't saved, Save your Mockup.
*   Add an image to your Mockup.
*   In the lower left corner of the Property Inspector, check "Copy to Project Assets" so this image will stay organized with the project and can be re-used in other mockups.

After you add an image, it will be available in the Property Inspector.
