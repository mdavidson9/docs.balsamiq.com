## Importing Wireframes From Another Project

You can copy wireframes from one project to another using the Import/Export Wireframe JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Wireframes JSON (Project > Export > Wireframe to JSON > Copy and Close) will copy the Balsamiq Wireframes code for the selected wireframe to the clipboard.

To create this wireframe in a new project, switch to it, choose “Import Wireframe JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code. Images and Symbols won't be copied, however.

## Importing From Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop

Because Mockups 3 for Desktop uses the same file format (BMPR) that Balsamiq Cloud uses, importing files there is a pretty straight forward process. You can directly upload your file as a [project](../projects/) there.

## Importing From myBalsamiq

If you are using myBalsamiq and would like to move your wireframes to Balsamiq Cloud, here is the way to download a project from your myBalsamiq project page:

The option is also available from your myBalsamiq home page:

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-download-BMPR-home.png)

The “Download BMPR” option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. You can then directly upload your file as a [project](../projects/) in Balsamiq Cloud.
